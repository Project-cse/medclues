# MEDCLUES Healthcare Platform

**MEDCLUES** (formerly MediChain+) is a full-stack healthcare management ecosystem connecting **patients**, **doctors**, **hospital receptionists**, **hospital deans**, and **super administrators**. It supports appointment booking, medical records, real-time queue tracking, Razorpay payments, Agora video consultations, AI medical chat, emergency services, labs, blood banks, front-desk reception operations, and multi-portal administration.

> **Recent updates**
> - **Flutter booking UX refresh** — saved patient profiles, book-for-others across pay-at-clinic and Razorpay flows, booking success messaging, and an upcoming appointments floating bar above the bottom navigation.
> - **Per-patient active booking rule** — a logged-in user may book for multiple people, but each actual patient can have only one active appointment until it is completed/cancelled.
> - **Appointment lifecycle notifications** — timeline status, colored chips, live queue state, and FCM "you're next" push notifications.
> - **Testing-friendly payments** — advance-payment enforcement can be disabled locally with `ADVANCE_PAYMENT_ENFORCED=false` while Razorpay online payment remains available.
> - **Booking source tracking** — appointments now carry an explicit `appointment_source` (`ONLINE` = app, `WALK_IN` = reception desk). Migration: `fastapi_back/migrations/021_appointment_source.sql`.
> - **Unified queue tokens** — online and walk-in appointments for the same doctor/day share one continuous token sequence.
> - **Reception Patients page** — lists every hospital patient with Type (Online/Walk-in), Payment Type, Paid/Unpaid, a Cancelled badge (sorted to the bottom), and a calendar date filter.
> - **Receptionist panel** — hospital-scoped reception desk in `admin/`, with one receptionist per hospital managed by the Dean / Super Admin. See [admin/README.md](admin/README.md).
> - **Mobile** — in-call chat in video consults, symptom/report sharing, onboarding-tour fixes, and hospital banner display. See [flutter_mobile/README.md](flutter_mobile/README.md).

★ **Recommended mobile client:** `flutter_mobile/` — full patient app with standalone emergency module.

### Application architecture style

**MedClues is a modular monolith** — one FastAPI backend with internal modules (auth, appointments, queue, pharmacy, community, …), one PostgreSQL source of truth, and many client apps. It is **not** a microservices mesh.

## Application Architecture Style

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Primary style? | **Modular monolith** |
| Microservices? | **No** (partners like PharmaSync are *external* integrations) |
| Scale pattern? | Run **more copies** of the same API + Redis + optional workers |
| Source of truth? | **PostgreSQL**; Redis is cache/OTP/rate-limit/realtime only |

## Client Applications

> **Production shipping surface:** `fastapi_back/` + `flutter_mobile/` + `admin/`.  
> `frontend/` (patient web) and `mobile/` (Expo) are **legacy / non-production** — kept for reference and limited testing; they do not match Flutter feature parity (community, health protection, enterprise AI assistant).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| Flutter SDK | 3.3+ (for `flutter_mobile/`) |
| PostgreSQL | Local or cloud (e.g. Neon) |

### 1. Backend (required for all clients)

```bash
cd fastapi_back
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Configure fastapi_back/.env (see Environment Configuration)
python scripts/run_migrations.py   # Apply pending DB migrations
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
```

Migrations also run automatically on API startup when PostgreSQL is connected. See [fastapi_back/migrations/README.md](fastapi_back/migrations/README.md).

- API docs: `http://localhost:5000/docs`
- Integrations check: `GET /api/config/integrations`
- Use `--host 0.0.0.0` so phones/emulators on the same network can connect

### 2. Patient Web

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# Configure frontend/.env (VITE_BACKEND_URL, Firebase, Razorpay)
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Admin & Doctor Portal

```bash
cd admin
npm install
# Configure admin/.env (VITE_BACKEND_URL, VITE_ENABLE_SOCKET)
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5174
```

### 4. Expo Mobile (React Native)

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
# Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL in mobile/.env to http://<YOUR_PC_LAN_IP>:5000
npm run sync-api
npx expo start -c
```

Phone and PC must be on the **same Wi‑Fi**.

### 5. Flutter Mobile — MEDCLUES (recommended)

```bash
cd flutter_mobile
flutter pub get
.\sync_env.ps1       # Copies API URL from mobile/.env
flutter run          # or: flutter run -d chrome
```

Build a release APK:

```bash
cd flutter_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

See **[flutter_mobile/README.md](flutter_mobile/README.md)** for complete setup.

### Quick Run All (typical dev session)

| Terminal | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | `cd fastapi_back && python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload` |
| 2 | `cd frontend && npm run dev` |
| 3 | `cd admin && npm run dev` |
| 4 | `cd flutter_mobile && flutter run -d chrome` |

### Receptionist Portal (one receptionist per hospital — hospital-scoped access)

Each hospital has its own receptionist account. A receptionist only ever sees data for their own hospital (appointments, doctors, queue, payments, follow-ups, refunds, no-shows). On the login page, select the **Receptionist** portal card.

## Appointment Lifecycle & Public IDs

MEDCLUES uses **backward-compatible** PostgreSQL migrations. Numeric primary keys are unchanged; human-readable **public IDs** and a formal **appointment lifecycle** sit on top.

### Public ID formats

| Entity | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Patient | `PAT` + 8 digits | `PAT00000006` |
| Doctor | `DOC` + 8 digits | `DOC00000012` |
| Dean | `DEA` + 8 digits | `DEA00000001` |
| Admin | `ADM` + 8 digits | `ADM00000001` |
| Appointment | `APT` + year + seq | `APT2026…` |
| Payment | `PAY` + year + seq | `PAY2026…` |
| Health record | `REC` + year + seq | `REC2026…` |
| Booking QR | `BK` + 6 chars | `BK8X4P2` |

Runbook: [docs/migrations/PUBLIC_IDS_RUNBOOK.md](docs/migrations/PUBLIC_IDS_RUNBOOK.md)

### Lifecycle states

`BOOKED` → `CONFIRMED` → `CHECKED_IN` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` → `FOLLOWUP_AVAILABLE` → `CLOSED`

Also: `CANCELLED`, `NO_SHOW`, `RESCHEDULED_ONCE`, `EXPIRED`, `REFUND_PENDING`, `REFUNDED`, `FOLLOWUP_EXPIRED`

Legacy `status` values (`pending`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `in-consult`) remain for older clients.

### Enforced policies (backend)

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Single active appointment** | Enforced per actual patient, not just per logged-in user. A user can book for others, but the same patient cannot have another active `BOOKED` / `CONFIRMED` / `CHECKED_IN` / `IN_PROGRESS` appointment until completion/cancel |
| **Slot capacity** | OPD and video slots respect per-hospital capacity (row locking + count validation) |
| **Visit validity** | `validity_days`, `max_visits` per hospital; QR scan increments `visit_count` |
| **Refunds** | First cancellation: 100% refund; later: platform fee deducted; 3–4 working days |
| **Paid no-show** | One grace reschedule (`RESCHEDULED_ONCE`); second miss → `EXPIRED` |
| **Follow-up** | After `COMPLETED`, configurable `followup_days` / `followup_visits` per hospital |
| **Trust score** | Default 100; no-shows, late cancels, and refunds adjust score; low scores require advance payment or admin review. Local/testing can pause advance payment with `ADVANCE_PAYMENT_ENFORCED=false` |

### Database migrations

```bash
cd fastapi_back
python scripts/run_migrations.py
```

| Migration | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `010`–`012` | Identity FK hardening and public ID prep |
| `013_public_ids` | Public ID columns and backfill |
| `014_appointment_lifecycle` | Lifecycle columns, hospital policies |
| `015_appointment_lifecycle_extended` | Refunds, grace requests, trust score, visit log |
| `017_hospital_background_image` | Hospital banner image column |
| `018_doctor_schedule` | Doctor OP timings + available days |
| `019_vc_chat` | In-call video-consult chat messages |
| `020_receptionist_panel` | Receptionists table + reception desk columns on appointments |
| `021_appointment_source` | Online vs walk-in appointment source tracking |
| `028_actual_patient_phone` | Stores actual patient phone for book-for-others and per-patient active-booking checks |

Rollbacks live in `fastapi_back/migrations/rollbacks/`. Full list: [fastapi_back/migrations/README.md](fastapi_back/migrations/README.md).

## Emergency Services

Emergency is implemented at **three levels**:

| Client | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Flutter (`flutter_mobile/`)** | Full standalone module — login-independent, local storage, GPS, WhatsApp alerts, auto-SOS timer |
| **Web (`frontend/`)** | `/emergency` page with GPS, contacts, nearby hospitals, backend alert |
| **API** | `POST /api/emergency/send-alert` (SMS service, dev-log mode) |

### Flutter Emergency Module (full feature set)

- Emergency Help on splash, login, register, home, profile, settings
- Routes: `/emergency`, `/emergency/settings`, `/emergency/active` (no login required)
- Auto-SOS countdown (configurable, stops on any user action)
- Flows: Critical / Can Respond (symptoms) / Help Someone Else
- GPS live location (Google Maps link)
- Up to 2 relative contacts (SharedPreferences)
- WhatsApp message + live location (not WhatsApp calls)
- Regular phone calls to relatives
- Nearby hospitals, ambulance/police/fire (testing mode available)
- Local case history (last 50 cases)

Details: [flutter_mobile/README.md — Emergency Module](flutter_mobile/README.md#emergency-module)

## Emergency Partner Platform

The **MEDCLUES Emergency Partner Platform** allows third-party applications (like SHAMS, IRCTC, and Uber) to integrate with MEDCLUES as the central end-to-end emergency management workflow system.

### Key Features

*   **Secure API & Auth Middleware:** Signed partner requests using `X-Api-Key` and HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.
*   **Live Dean Command Center (`/dean-er-dispatch`):** Hospital-scoped dashboard for Deans, now featuring:
    *   **Navbar Tabs:** Separate tabs for `Incoming Live` (active dispatches) and `Already Completed` (historical archives).
    *   **Search Engine:** Instant query filter by patient name, phone, or case ID.
    *   **Date Calendar Picker:** Live historical lookup for past dates directly from PostgreSQL.
    *   **Standard Export:** Integrates your native `<ExportMenu>` component to compile and download Excel/CSV reports.
*   **Ambulance Dispatch Telemetry:** Fleet management tables, driver credentials/login, active GPS ping logging, and real-time Socket.IO dispatch rooms (`case:{public_id}`) for live Leaflet map tracking.
*   **Reliable Webhook Worker:** An asynchronous, exponential backoff webhook delivery worker (`webhook_retry_worker.py`) that retries partner updates (1m ➡️ 5m ➡️ 30m ➡️ 2h ➡️ 24h) and tracks full response status, with an Admin manual-retry dashboard interface.
*   **PostGIS Proximity Search (Phase 4):** Spatial GIST indexes and automated database trigger syncer to calculate nearby hospital allocations 10–100× faster.

**Full documentation:** [EMERGENCY_PARTNER_PLATFORM.md](./docs/EMERGENCY_PARTNER_PLATFORM.md)
**SHAMS Integration code:** [scratch/shams_integration/](scratch/shams_integration/)

## Development Notes

- **Production clients:** Flutter (`flutter_mobile/`) + Admin (`admin/`) + FastAPI (`fastapi_back/`)
- **Legacy (non-production):** `frontend/` patient web and `mobile/` Expo — do not treat as shipping surfaces
- **Support contact:** `SUPPORT_EMAIL=medichain123@gmail.com`, `SUPPORT_PHONE=1800-123-4567`
- **Branding:** Product name is **MedClues / MEDCLUES** (store package IDs may still say `medichain` until rename)
- **Primary mobile:** Use `flutter_mobile/` for new patient mobile development
- **API URL on devices:** Never use `localhost` on physical phones — use your PC's LAN IP
- **Emergency testing mode:** `EmergencyConstants.testingMode = true` in Flutter blocks ambulance/police/fire calls
- **Migrations:** Run `python scripts/run_migrations.py` after pulling backend changes
- **Lifecycle flags:** Set `APPOINTMENT_LIFECYCLE_ENFORCED`, `TRUST_SCORE_ENFORCED`, and `ADVANCE_PAYMENT_ENFORCED` in `fastapi_back/.env`
- **Book-for-others:** Always capture the actual patient's phone number so the backend can enforce one active appointment per patient while still allowing a user to book for family members.
- **Flutter release APK:** Build from `flutter_mobile/` with `flutter build apk --release`; output is `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- **JWT expiry:** ~7 days; no separate refresh endpoint — re-login on 401
- **Hot reload:** Flutter `r`/`R`; Vite HMR for web clients

---

## License & Security

- Keep all `.env` files and credential markdown files **out of public repositories**
- Healthcare data handled per MEDCLUES protocol standards
- Role-based access: patients, doctors, receptionists, deans, and admins have isolated data scopes
- Dean accounts are restricted to their own hospital's doctors and patients
- Receptionist accounts are restricted to a single hospital's front-desk data (bookings, queue, payments)
